# Web-Authoring


A new superstore is opening soon and requires an interactive website to facilitate its online shopping business. The business includes online shopping (of multiple various types of products) and delivery to customers. The web presence (i.e. website) should help the business to market their services and increase their customer base.

This is an independent piece of work for which you must create a web site for the aforementioned pseudo company. The website should be implemented using the latest web technologies; HTML 5 and CSS 3. Appropriate supporting scripting should be used, such as JavaScript, as required. The web site markup should be written in a plain text editor, such as Notepad++ (not in a web page editor.) So, the use of Dreamweaver, FrontPage or similar programs/applications is NOT permitted. Front end frameworks should not be used, including examples such as Bootstrap and Foundation. The web site should contain several (e.g. 4-6 different pages) of content. The page content might include (as a minimum) information such as, products and services, operating hours, contact details, delivery territory, pricing, seasonal promotions/deals and customer testimonials. This list is by no means exhaustive, it is merely indicative of the type of content you may wish to include.
You should aim to apply as many technical features as possible, where appropriate, to demonstrate your skills and competence. These include, but are not limited to:
 Hyperlinks
 Text effects and graphical styles (drop shadows, gradients, rounded corners,
JavaScript, web fonts and transparencies)
 Multimedia (embedded objects, images, galleries, SVG, video, audio, transitions/ transformations, drag and drop)
 Local web storage
 Geolocation.
 Advanced Javascript functionality, including functionalities beyond what was covered in lectures & workshops.
 Web standards and validation
